1.3 DESCRIPTION
===============

until runs a command with a specified maximum timeout, or optionally
disables the timeout if a certain string is found in the output.  The
main use for this command is system administrators who write maintenance
tasks, and do not want them to hang.

1.5 EXAMPLES
============

'until 300 ./myFtpScript.pl'

'until 30 -T "ogin:" ssh user@somehost /opt/software/acme/nightlyjob.sh'
     Try to ssh to somehost and run nightlyjob.sh, if it sees the string
     "ogin:" (as in login or Login), it disables the timer, otherwise

1.6 CAVEATS
===========

until runs the command executed and if within the timeout returns the
status of the command executed.  If the timeout is exceeded the return
value is non zero.  If it is necessary to distinguish between the
timeout being reached or the command that was executed returning an
error, until outputs "until: Operation timed out" to stdout.  Although
the data received is copied verbatim, running an ssh command with until
that times out can leave your terminal in an unpredictable state, as if
you forecfully exited a program using curses
